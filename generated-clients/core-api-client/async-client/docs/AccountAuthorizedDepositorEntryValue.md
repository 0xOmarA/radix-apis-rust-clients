# AccountAuthorizedDepositorEntryValue

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**is_authorized** | **bool** | This is always true. This field is just added to ensure we return some data as the value, so a present entry is not confused by clients for a deleted/missing entry (which would imply not authorized).  |
